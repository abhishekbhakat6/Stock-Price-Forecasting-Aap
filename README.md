## 📈 Stock Price Forecasting Web App using LSTM and Streamlit
🔍 Project Overview
I built this interactive stock price forecasting web application using Python, LSTM neural networks, Streamlit, and Yahoo Finance API as part of my internship.
The app allows users to dynamically input any stock symbol (e.g., AAPL) and:

- Fetch real-time historical stock data for the past 5 years.
- Train an LSTM model directly within the app.
- Forecast up to 60 future stock market days.
- Visualize the complete trend with dynamic plots.

🚀 Key Features

🧠 LSTM-based time series forecasting model.

📅 User-defined forecasting window (1 to 60 days).

📊 Interactive visualizations using Matplotlib.

⚡ Fully dynamic Streamlit web app interface.
